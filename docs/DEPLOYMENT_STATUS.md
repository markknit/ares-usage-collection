# Deployment Status

## tsavo3 pilot school server

Validated on 2026-07-27.

### Role

`tsavo3` is the pilot school-side ARES server and usage-data source. It is not yet the production central processor or public setup portal host.

### Installed components

- `/usr/local/sbin/ares_prepare_usage_upload.sh`
- `/etc/ares/usage-upload.conf`
- `/mnt/sda3/var/www/tracker/prepare_usage_upload.php`
- `/mnt/sda3/var/www/tracker/collection_schedule.json`
- `/mnt/sda3/var/www/tracker/uploads/`
- `/etc/sudoers.d/ares-usage-export`

The runtime configuration and sudoers file are server-local and are not stored in this repository.

### Current pilot identifier

- Host: `tsavo3`
- School/export code: `TSAVO3`
- Report source: `/mnt/sda3/var/www/tracker/reports/combined_usage.csv`
- Local export endpoint: `http://ares.local/tracker/prepare_usage_upload.php?collection=AUTO`
- Collection schedule: `http://ares.local/tracker/collection_schedule.json`

### Validation completed

- Repository portal validation passed for two configured schools.
- Static portal tests passed.
- Export shell script passed `bash -n` syntax validation.
- PHP endpoint passed `php -l` syntax validation.
- Existing report builder completed successfully.
- Timestamped CSV export was generated in the tracker uploads directory.
- Exported CSV contained the expected header and usage records.
- SHA-256 metadata was generated.
- Nginx/PHP request returned HTTP 200.
- Response content type was CSV.
- Response supplied a timestamped `ARES_USAGE_TSAVO3_AUTO_*.csv` filename.
- Downloaded CSV size matched the generated report.
- Android phone successfully downloaded the expected timestamped CSV from `ares.local` while connected to the ARES network.

### Next milestone

Validate delayed Android upload to the central OneDrive Incoming folder:

1. Preserve the downloaded CSV while the phone has no internet connection.
2. Configure and test the Round Sync upload task.
3. Restore internet access to the phone.
4. Confirm the CSV reaches the central OneDrive Incoming folder.
5. Confirm the file is removed from the phone only after successful upload.
